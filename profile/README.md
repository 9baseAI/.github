*Frontier generative intelligence and autonomous agents catalyzing a paradigm shift in neuroscience and brain-centric medicine.*

---

## Vision
We envisage artificial intelligence as a rigorously validated, ethically aligned, and universally accessible conduit for decoding neurobiological complexity and promoting neurological well-being.

## Mission
To architect an end-to-end platform that leverages domain-conditioned Large Language Models and self-governing AI Agents to augment clinical and research decision-making with sub-specialty precision, while enshrining patient confidentiality through uncompromising privacy-by-design.

## Core Expertise
- **Foundation-scale & instruction-tuned generative language models** trained on curated neuro-centric corpora  
- **Orchestrated autonomous-agent frameworks** for high-integrity clinical workflow automation  
- **Computational Neuro-AI, multimodal neuroinformatics & digital neurology**  
- **Standards-conformant federation** of FHIR, DICOM, electrophysiological, imaging, and omic datasets
